Hello and welcome to this blog. Here I will record some of my notes through my  learning of ML, for now , this blog includes  notes of fastai lessons and Reinforce Learning of David Silver's lessons. Hope you can find something that you need here.

As I'm a postgraduate of China, I might sometimes write in Chinese, so maybe this blog is more suitable for Chinese to read.
